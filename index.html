       As of right now, <mark>239.5M</mark> in the United States play sports. Roughly <mark>500K</mark> play collegiately. And only 13.6K make it professionally. 
       That means that only <mark>0.000056%</mark> of the people living in the US who play sports will make it their profession! You really must be a diamond in the rough to make it that far,
       and as the saying goes pressure either bursts pipes or makes diamonds so you can imagine how many "pipe dreams" are busted every year (no pun intended). Furthermore, out of those rarified 
       diamonds, an even smaller few will ever hoist a trophy in their career. So what's the impetus behind greatness? It's not enough to say it's intrinsic, one either has it or doesn't. And good fortune can only take one so far. So, if the genome of a champion is more than luck and skill, what's the missing strand of DNA? Hard work? Well, &nbsp; yes!
       But more than just that. It's a deep desire to compete at the highest level until the job is done. Unlike genetic traits in the biological sense, these types of "genes" can either be inherited or ingrained. By ingrained, I mean they are passed 
       down from one idol to a future one. Just as a lion viciously fights a pride leader for superiority, a future "idol" will eventually challenge the current for supremacy. And as nature goes, the cycyle repeats. Here, we will take a look at two examples 
       where this idol transition occurs.

        <h3>Women's Tennis: <b>Monica Seles</b> ==> <b>Serena Williams</b></h3>

        <p>At the age of 15, Monica Seles turned professional on February 13, 1989. Just four months later, she reached the French Open semi-finals, a Grand Slam, only to fall to then world 
            #1 Steffi Graf. A year later she voyaged on a 36-match winning streak including 6 consecutive tournament championships. From January of 1990 through August of 1993, she would win eight of the 11 
            Women's Grand Slam tournaments. During the year of 1993 she suffered an unimaginable setback as she was attacked on the court by a dillusioned spectator during a match in Germany. Although she was never able 
            to return to her true form, she continued playing until 2005. At which point the Williams sisters had came into form and was dominating tournaments left and right. Serena Williams, the younger sister, rattled 
            off four consecutive Grand Slam tournament victories. From <mark>2001 to 2017</mark>, Serena won a Grand Slam in every year with the exception of just three years.

        <h3>NBA: <b>Wilt Chamberlain</b> ==> <b>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</b></h3>

        <p>In the NBA season of 1961/62, Wilt Chamberlain averaged 50 POINTS PER GAME! Need I even say more? The most dominant power forward for almost a decade, Wilt was a one-name epitome of 
            greatness. He consistently led the league in scoring and rebounding winning seven scoring titles and four league MVPs. But far more than an offensive menace, he was a terror on defense making even the best of guards second guess before driving 
            to the basket. Unfortunately, the league was not keeping track of defensive stats during Wilt's time so it's hard to put his defensive aptitude into context, but it was during his successor's, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Born as Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr., 
            Kareem managed outdue even Wilt's greatness! A 15-time All-NBA selection and six-time league MVP, Kareem personified greatness more than any other before him had ever tried. He mastered the "sky hook" which helped lead the Los Angeles Lakers to 
            several NBA Championships. To this day, no other NBA player has ever came to close to replicating his signature sky hook move.</p>
